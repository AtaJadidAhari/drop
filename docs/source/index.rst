DROP - Detection of RNA Outliers Pipeline
==========================================

DROP is intended to help researchers use RNA-Seq data in order to detect genes with aberrant expression, aberrant splicing and mono-allelic expression. It consists of three independent modules for each of those strategies. 
After installing DROP, the user needs to fill in the config file and sample annotation table (Preparing Input Data). Then, the DROP can be executed in multiple ways (Executing the Pipeline).
