# Zoom call with Chris

Daniel was late, then Chris was late.

## sample annotation with Tom

- code in visual basic applications (VBA)
- automation of pipeline to master table
- no post-processing of columns, yet
- if error, add comment in IHG table with updated matching; do not change ID columns
- check if RNA MUC ids are also in master table
- consistent file structure on gagneur side using symlinks for file path
- clinician present? where is clinician to patient_id info stored?
- date: fibroblast taken, RNAseq done?
- decide if corrections of typos, how many levels per column
- re-implementation in R or python needed?
