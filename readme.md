# Genetic diagnosis of Mendelian disorders

Goals:

* Setup pipeline from Kremer, Bader paper.
* Plug and Play for new RNA samples
    * using aberrant expression pkg
    * using splicing pkg
    * develop MAE functions/pkg
* extend  pipeline by proteomics

## Diagnosis tools:
- [Webserver](https://i12g-gagneurweb.in.tum.de/project/genetic_diagnosis/)
- [TABLE of disease associated genes](https://i12g-gagneurweb.in.tum.de/project/genetic_diagnosis/#Scripts_diagnosis_tools_disease_associated_genes.html)
- [Patient reports](https://i12g-gagneurweb.in.tum.de/shinyserver/)
